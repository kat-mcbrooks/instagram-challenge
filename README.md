# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rubocop', '1.20', require: false
  gem 'rubocop-rails'
end
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
